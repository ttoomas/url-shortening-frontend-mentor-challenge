## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my best frontend-mentor challenge. Because I haven't had experience with API or local-storage yet. Thanks to this challenge, I learned to work with both the API and the local-storage. I practiced my skills in building a bigger project. I am proud of my solution.
